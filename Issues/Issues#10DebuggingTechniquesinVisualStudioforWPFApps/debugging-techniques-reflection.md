# Reflection

## Which debugging tools in Visual Studio do you find most useful and why?

The tools I find most useful are the combination of breakpoints and the Watch
Window, since they allow me to verify if variables are being updated correctly
based on user input.

## Reflect on a scenario where a specific debugging feature helped you identify and resolve an issue.

In my example, the expected output was supposed to be double the input. However,
the result was the same as the input, meaning the multiplication was not
happening correctly. Thanks to the Watch Window, I was able to verify that the
conversion was not working as expected and fix the issue.

## How might improving your debugging skills impact your overall productivity?

Improving my debugging skills would help me identify errors earlier, especially
in conversions or function calls, and prevent them more effectively.
