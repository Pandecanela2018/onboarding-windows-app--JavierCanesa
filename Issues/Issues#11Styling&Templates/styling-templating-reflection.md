# Reflection

## How can using styles enforce consistency across your application?

Using styles in a project helps provide coherence about what the application is
about, highlighting the colors, fonts, and how each button works. It also shows
the purpose of the application. A clear example is Focus Bear: the application
uses bright colors to make it clear that it is designed to attract attention,
since its audience is people with ADHD.

## Reflect on the benefits and challenges of using control templates

### The benefits that may arise from using control templates are

-Greater control over the appearance of a specific object without affecting its
functionality.

-Reusability of the template.

-More flexible maintenance.

### The challenges faced are

-It takes longer to create template by template.

-Higher performance consumption if there are too many templates.

## How might templating improve the maintainability of your UI?

Maintenance with templates is more flexible because, for example, if you want to
modify a template for buttons without breaking their functionality, you can do
so with templates since youâ€™re only changing or updating their appearance.
