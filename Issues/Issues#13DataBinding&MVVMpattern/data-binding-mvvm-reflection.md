# Reflection

## How does data binding improve the separation of concerns in your application?

Data binding allows information to automatically flow between the user interface
and the Models or ViewModels without the need to manually write synchronization
code. This improves the separation of concerns since each component (View,
ViewModel, Model) focuses on its specific role. In addition, by keeping logic
out of the UI, it becomes easier to perform unit testing on Models and
ViewModels, which simplifies error detection and system maintenance.

## Reflect on how MVVM can simplify testing and maintenance

Since ViewModels are decoupled from the Views, it becomes easier to perform unit
tests on each one, making it possible to solve problems or modify the code
without affecting the UI.

## What challenges might arise when applying these concepts to larger applications?

One challenge is the difficulty of structuring the entire project with MVVM. It
can also become heavy and complex when debugging in larger applications.
