# Reflection

## Reflect on a time when proper exception handling prevented a major issue?

When we have important classes or functions, if you donâ€™t follow the
instructions, you could break the code.

## What debugging techniques did you find most effective?

In my opinion, breakpoints are the most important when debugging your code
because they let you decide where to begin debugging. in addition, you can
follow execution step by step as you prefer, identifying each class by its parts
and method calls.

## How can you improve error logging and reporting in your code?

Using try-catch and exception messages, you can classify each execution message
to know what went wrong.
