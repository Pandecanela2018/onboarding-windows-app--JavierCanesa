# Reflection

## which collection type do you find most useful for different scenarios and why?

I think the most useful collection for me is the dictionary because it is faster
and efficient. If you need to search for data, you can easily find it because
the collection only needs a key, but it is performance may be slow in some
scenarios.

## How does using LINQ improve code readability and efficiency?

It is very effective when you need to filter data from your database into your
program, and it is faster than using collections.

On the other hand, it is easier to read because you can use syntax that is
almost the same as SQL, making it easier to read the data you want.

## Reflect on a situation where switching to a LINQ-based

To filter information from the database, you normally have to use several nested
for loops and if statements to filter all the data and get the value you need.
However, with LINQ you can filter the data containing the characters or values
you need without using too many if statements.
