# Reflection

## Which OOP principle did you find most challenging and why?

Polymorphism is the most difficult for me because we often need to add more
attributes to a subclass. It can be a bit challenging since you have to think
carefully about which attributes to add depending on the function the class wil
have.

## How does applying OOP concepts enhance code reusability and maintainability?

Using the OOP paradigm in your projects improves maintenance and performance
because having everything organized and well-structured makes it easier to find
errors. In addition, you can reuse classes many times.

## Reflect on a scenario where using OOP made a project easier to manage

In a project where I was developing an online sales program, the application
included functions for buying and selling products. Using OOP made the project
much easier to manage. I created classes that handled the main operations, such
as Sale and Purchase, which allowed me to manage instances whenever a product
was sold or bought. Additionally, I designed a Product class to store all
relevant information, such as name, brand, and other attributes. Later, if new
product types needed to be added, I could simply extend or create new classes
without modifying the existing code, keeping the project organized, scalable,
and easy to maintain.
