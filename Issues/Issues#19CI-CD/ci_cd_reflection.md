# What is the purpose of CI/CD?

The purpose of this method is to provide successful updates and resolve
issues quickly. In addition, it helps the team stay more organized.

## How does automating style checks improve project quality?

This way, you save time and can catch mistakes without reviewing everything
manually.

## What are some challenges with enforcing checks in CI/CD?

1 - You need knowledge of how to program actions and implement them in your
project.

2 - If the system isnâ€™t set up properly, it can lead to multiple errors or
allow documents with formatting issues to pass unnoticed.

## How do CI/CD pipelines differ between small projects and large teams?

**Small Project:**

- Simplified workflows
- Speed-focused
- Lower risk

In this case, you only need a little knowledge to set up workflows. You can
create a workflow that verifies if you have errors in your code or Markdown.

**Large Teams:**

- Complex workflows
- Strict validations
- Scalability

In this case, you need solid knowledge of how to organize and program specific
actions to detect errors in the code or other important documents before
merging into the main branch, in order to avoid conflicts.
