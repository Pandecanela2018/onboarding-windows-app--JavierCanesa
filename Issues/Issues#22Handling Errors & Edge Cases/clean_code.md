# Reflection

## What was the issue with the original code?

I created a simple example with a function, and it does a division by zero,
but in this case it is not handled, so my code breaks.

## How does handling errors improve reliability?

I think to handling errors is more important in software development.
In addition, It avoid errors with customer and prevent fatal errors in
the code.
