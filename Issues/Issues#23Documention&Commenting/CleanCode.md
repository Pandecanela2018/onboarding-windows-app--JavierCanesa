# Reflection

## When should you add comments?

When you find an error and fix it, or when you need to explain a function
or a structure, you should write clearly and directly. In addition,
when you suggest a change in the code, you should also be precise.

## When should you avoid comments and instead improve the code?

when the variable is clearly and you don't need to comment, for example

//this function addition two numbers.
Function addition(a,b){
return a + b
}

In this case, you donâ€™t have to comment. On the other hand,
if you need to improve the code, you should change variable names, like this:

int U = 10 ---> int ActiveUsers = 10.
