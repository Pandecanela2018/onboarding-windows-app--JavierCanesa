# Reflection

Because it helps improve readability in the code and makes it easier for
everyone to understand. In addition, having a consistent style helps
prevent future errors.

## What issues did the linter detect?

I had mistakes with tabs in all the files because I set only 2 tabs
for each line.

Yes, it did.
