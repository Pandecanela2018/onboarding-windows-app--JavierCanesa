# Reflection

## Summarize the following clean code principles

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Don't repeat the same function twice.

**SRP (Single Responsability Principle)**: Each function has to work for a
specific action.

**Readability:** The code should be easy to read and understand by any
developer.

**Clear Naming:** Good naming of variables and functions is very
important so that one can understand their function.

**Useful Comments:** Explain the purpose of the function or variable with a
clear and understandable comment.

**YAGNI (You are not going to need it):** Don't add a function that you don't need.
