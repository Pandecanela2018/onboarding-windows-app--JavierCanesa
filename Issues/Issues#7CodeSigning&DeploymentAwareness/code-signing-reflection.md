# Reflection

## Reflect on why code signing is a critical step in the deployment process

It is critical because it ensures that the software can run on platforms without
being flagged as malicious. In addition, it prevents code duplication by
external companies or individuals who might insert malicious viruses, and it
validates the integrity of the code.

## How does understanding the deployment process, even at a high level, impact your approach to development?

As a developer, you must know how to prepare the code with the proper structure
required to obtain certification. It also helps anticipate any errors that might
occur before or during distribution.

## What risks could arise if code signing is overlooked or improperly managed?

The software could be flagged as malicious and blocked by Windows, causing end
users to lose trust. It could also be plagiarized, allowing external agents to
introduce viruses to steal or encrypt user data. Additionally, there could be
legal consequences for not signing it properly.
