# Reflection

## How does effective logging contribute to faster troubleshooting and improved code quality?

Effective logging contributes to greater maintainability and readability of the
code in the long term. Since it records everything that has happened and is
currently happening in the system, it helps developers understand issues without
having to reproduce them simply by reviewing the logs.

## Reflect on the impact of exception handling on application stability and user trust.

Exception handling is very important to prevent users from having a bad
experience while using the application. It also allows developers to stay one
step ahead of potential errors that might occur during code execution, even the
smallest ones that could cause the system to fail.

## What strategies would you adopt to enhance logging in a complex application?

I would use the Serilog library to collect detailed information in formats such
as JSON or CSV, allowing faster problem resolution. In addition, I would apply
patterns that prevent small issues from breaking the entire system, such as
try-catch-finally blocks, and implement retry mechanisms for API connections to
handle transient errors more effectively.
